The Star_Detection.py module takes photos of deep space from the Hubble Space 
Telescope and detects the stars in the photo, counts the number of stars and 
displays the results via a visual representation.

The file messier.tiff is the photo that the module is preset to process.
If you would like to run the module, clone the photo and set the file
path in the source code.
