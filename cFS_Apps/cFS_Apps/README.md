The Crater_Detection.py module takes photos of the moon from the Lunar
Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) and detects the craters on the surface 
in order to determine a safe landing zone for a spacecraft.



The Star_Detection.py module takes photos of deep space from the Hubble Space 
Telescope and detects the stars in the photo, counts the number of stars and 
displays the results via a visual representation.
